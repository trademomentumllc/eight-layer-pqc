Level,Characteristics,Actions Required,Risk Profile
L1: Initial,Limited quantum threat awareness; No cryptographic inventory; Ad-hoc cryptography usage; No designated leadership,Conduct executive awareness sessions; Assign senior leadership; Begin preliminary assessment; Initiate board discussions,CRITICAL - Highly vulnerable to Q-Day and HNDL attacks; No coordinated response capability
L2: Exploratory,Quantum threat acknowledged; Exploring potential impacts; Scattered initiatives across units; Some vendor discussions begun,Complete comprehensive cryptographic inventory; Identify critical data assets; Develop governance structure; Establish quantum steering committee,HIGH - Significant exposure without coordinated response; Awareness present but action lacking
L3: Preliminary,Initial actions underway; Some inventory complete; Vendor discussions progressing; Budget discussions active,Prioritize asset migrations; Pilot PQC solutions in test environments; Establish success metrics; Secure budget commitments,MODERATE - Actively reducing exposure through targeted actions; Clear path emerging
L4: Developing,Active PQC deployment in testbeds; Trained technical workforce; Documented implementation processes; Vendor commitments secured,Scale deployments to production; Achieve vendor compliance; Execute continuous testing; Optimize performance,LOW - Proactive security posture; Clear migration path with momentum
L5: Operational,Widespread PQC deployment; Cryptographic agility operational; Continuous monitoring systems active; Full compliance achieved,Optimize system performance; Maintain vigilance on quantum developments; Adapt to emerging threats; Share best practices,MINIMAL - Quantum-ready infrastructure; Resilient and adaptive security posture
